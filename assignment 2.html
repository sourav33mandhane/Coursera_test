                <h2>Phishing</h2>
                <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering usually employed to steal user data such as credit card numbers and login credentials. 
                    It happens when an attacker, posing as a trusted individual, tricks the victim to open a text message, email, or instant message.
     
                    The victim is then deceived to open a malicious link that can cause the freezing of a system as part of a ransomware attack, revealing sensitive information, or installation of malware.

                <p>
                    A whale phishing attack is a type of phishing that centers on high-profile employees such as the CFO or CEO.
                     It is aimed at stealing vital information since those holding higher positions in a company have unlimited access to sensitive information. 
                    Most whaling instances manipulate the victim into permitting high-worth wire transfers to the attacker.

                <p>
                    Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a kind of injection breach where the attacker sends malicious scripts into content from otherwise reputable websites.
                     It happens when a dubious source is allowed to attach its own code into web applications,
                      and the malicious code is bundled together with dynamic content that is then sent to the victimâ€™s browser.
